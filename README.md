# DataStructuresAssignment1
First assignment of Data Structures

For this project, I created a program that computes the distance an object will fall in Earth's gravity. 

In the first part, I created a class called GravityCalculator and initialized the variables in it. I then output
the object's position after it falls for 10.0 seconds.

In the second part, I modified the example program to compute the position of an object after falling for 10 
seconds, outputting the position in meters. The formula in math notation is: 

x(t) = 0.5 * a * t^2 + v_i * t * x_i

Variables           Meaning                         Value
a                   Acceleration (m/(s^2))          -9.81
t                   Time (s)                        10
v_i                 Initial velocity (m/s)          0
x_i                 Initial position                0
